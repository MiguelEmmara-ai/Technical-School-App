# Technical-School-App

# Brief
For this assignment, you will individually develop a Technical School App (eight classes) in Java to determine whether or not a student is certified, their transcript is checked against a certification criterion. For this assignment, you will develop classes to store data for modules, students, and their transcripts. You will demonstrate the functionality of your code on sample transcripts.

# Methodology and Marking Scheme
You have been provided with an outline of eight classes that contain the core functionalities of the technical school app: Grade, ModuleType, Level, Module, Student, Result, TechnicalSchool, and StudentEvaluation. The relationships between classes are described below using a UML Class Diagram (Figure 1). Complete the assignment by using the given UML class diagram. Please use the following steps to develop the eight classes with the provided instance variables and methods using appropriate access modifiers (as shown in the diagram). Please take the time to test your methods as you progress.
Note: No other methods/instance variables are required. But feel free if you would like to add more methods!
